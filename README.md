## Logistic Regression Based Heart Disease Classification Model

Briefly put, this repository contains my jupyter notebooks practicing a machine learning workflow from data analysis, to prepartion, pipelines, modelling, tuning, evaluation
and further analysis with metrics such as ROC/AUC, feature importance analysis and other final steps. 

The final model created is a Logistic Regression based classification estimator with around a **90%
classification accuracy**, able to identify a presence (1) or lack thereof (0) of heart disease. The data the model has been trained upon is an open source data set from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease">**UCI Machine Learning Repository**</a>
and is solely being utilized for the purposes of learning.

For more details on information such as features, as well as the contained graphs and analysis, please view the jupyter notebook. The environment has also been prepackaged in a YML file for easy setup,
and the model is contained in a joblib file.

Thanks for taking interest in my first ever model/jupyter notebook workflow and learning process!
